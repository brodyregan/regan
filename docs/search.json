I am using data taken at Palmyra Atoll, an island in the Central Pacific. The data includes 3d models of coral reef sections and fish videos, both taken at respective exclusion cages. The goal of this project is to identify the relationship surgeon and damsel fish have with coral reef recovery rates."

Points represent observations of average tussock height (cm) at site location (burned or unburned). The center black dots represent the mean height, and the bars represent the standard error, both respective to their site. Colors represent site (red = burned, dark green = unburned).\n\n\n\nIn this problem, I worked with a data set from “Rocha, A. 2021: Tussock height and diameter in moist acidic tussock tundra at the site of the 2007 Anaktuvuk River fire scar, and nearby unburned tundra measured in 2016 ver 1. Environmental Data Initiative.” The dataset includes information about the Tussock (a type of grass) height in burned and unburned regions to study how ecosystems recover after a fire.\nIn my code, I loaded the data set and summary statistics which included the mean, standard error, and individual data points. Using the ggplot function, I created a jitter plot with the mean and standard error. Within the code, I adjusted the colors, jitter offset, theme, labels, mean/standard error aesthetics, and more.\nCreating a jitter plot allowed me to visually see the difference in means. It effectively worked in this situation because there were only to sites to compare and the data was normally distributed. The mean is an important aspect to compare because it provides the best idea as to what the population is generally like. The standard error is also important to include because it [gives a clue to how accurate the mean is and how wide the data range is provides precision and variability of the mean. Based on the visualization, it appears that on average, tussocks grow taller after a fire."

My goal was determine geological factors that influence composition and structure of formations in the Anza Borrego region, Southern California.\nIn the first map, I used NASA ASTER data to create an overlay of different types of sedimentary rocks shown by the different colors. RASTER Math equations allowed me to take multiple ASTER images and create an RBG image. Based on historical data, we can see how the different compositions of rocks correlate with where ancient river and ocean beds used to be.\nIn the second map, I used Digital Elevation Maps from the USGS data system to create a topography map in QGIS. Using other functions, I show where water drains giving insight about how rainfall and rivers formed the divide down the center of the moutain range."
