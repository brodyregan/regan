I am using data taken at Palmyra Atoll, an island in the Central Pacific. The data includes 3d models of coral reef sections and fish videos, both taken at respective exclusion cages. The goal of this project is to identify the relationship surgeon and damsel fish have with coral reef recovery rates."
